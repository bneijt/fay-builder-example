fay-builder-example
===================

![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/bneijt/fay-builder-example.svg?branch=master)

This is a simple fay-builder full example. See the above Travis CI information for the build status.

This example was created using http://engineering.silk.co/post/82777010096/writing-admin-interfaces-with-fay-using-fay-builder

However, I've found it problematic to build it with new versions of cabal and ghc
